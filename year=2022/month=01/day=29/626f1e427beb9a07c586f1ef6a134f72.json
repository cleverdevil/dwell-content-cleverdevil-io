Main Synopsis: The new school year is starting, and Stephanie, who is entering 2nd grade, is the only Tanner left in her school, and she expects a bad day at school, but instead, it turns out to be a good day for Stephanie. The same can't be said for 12-year-old D.J., who is entering 7th grade, a step closer to becoming a teenager. On her first day in junior high, D.J. is humiliated by Colleen and Susan, a couple of bullies. On the next morning, D.J. decides to put on make-up, because she believes the only way to fit in among the 7th graders is to do what Kimmy and virtually all of the other 7th grade girls are doing -- look twice as old as she really is by putting on makeup. Danny thinks D.J. is overdoing it, so he lets Becky help D.J. with the makeup. Meanwhile, Joey tries to teach Jesse how to play golf so they can impress a client who likes to play golf.</p>\n\n                                <p style=\"font-style: italic; text-align: right;\">Watched on Trakt</p>",
