Which Bible verse most contradicts its own book? There\u2019s a Toad the Wet Sprocket song about the apostles being sick of Paul lol. What are the Bible\u2019s best name meanings? Every Catholic heresy, given a thumbs up or thumbs down! Do animals have souls? Do Christians, um, like, kinda, you know, wish for death, um, so they can go to Heaven, welp? What\u2019s the Bible\u2019s scariest verse? A light round of Calvinism vs. Arminianism! Is it fun or bad when Pop Culture makes versions of Bible stories? Well, Jason\u2019s making a book, how\u2019s that going?
