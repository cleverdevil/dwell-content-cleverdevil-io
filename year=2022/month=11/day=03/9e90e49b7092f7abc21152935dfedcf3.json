Fisher recently left Google, where he worked on Chrome, to work on <a href=\"https://arc.net\">Arc</a>, a new browser in private-preview from <a href=\"https://thebrowser.company/\">The Browser Company</a>.

Better tab management means less searching; sending you straight to the page you want means fewer search results and fewer ad impressions. Making you close your tabs and reopen them all the time isn\u2019t just acceptable for Chrome; it\u2019s a victory.
