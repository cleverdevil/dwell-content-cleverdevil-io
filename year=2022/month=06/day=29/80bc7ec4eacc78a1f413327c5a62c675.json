Why doesn\u2019t Spurrier have much of a coaching tree, and why are Florida fans already getting impatient with a new coach who was quite explicit about needing time? (Note: We recorded this before he wrote an open letter.) Would it be good for the MWC if Boise had a few down years? Is Bowling Green in win-or-get-fired mode? Why can\u2019t a mid-tier P5 like Arizona State take advantage of demography the way a blue-blood like Georgia can? What do we make of a recent booster revolt at Louisville?
