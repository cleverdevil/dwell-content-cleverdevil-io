Watney may be a \u201cnerdy botanist,\u201d as he describes himself, but he\u2019s also extremely witty. Long passages of scientific exposition are frequently interspersed with wise cracks, one-liners, and mischief. If Watney is going to be stuck on Mars, he\u2019s at least going to make the best of it.
