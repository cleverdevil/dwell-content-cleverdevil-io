The hotel is absolutely stunning, with an excellent view of the bay, large rooms, and good food.  Its really a nice change from Kyoto!  Hiroshima is also a much cleaner and more modern city than Kyoto, since it was essentially completely destroyed in fairly recent history.  The streets are cleaner, the buildings more modern and attractive, and much more organized.</p><p>The only real downside for our hotel is that it is very far from the center of the city.  We can take busses into town, but they cost \u00a5230 each way (roughly $2.00 USD), so you have to really plan your days out.  We cannot really walk anywhere but to the laundry.  But, all in all, I really do enjoy the hotel quite a bit, and its a great change of pace.  In addition, our hotel is right across the street from a massive indoor snowboarding arena, which sounds like a lot of fun!</p><p>My first day in Hiroshima I spent doing laundry, and relaxing back at the hotel.  But, today I actually went into the city!  We first went to Hiroshima Castle,  which is a fairly modern building, but is built in the traditional Japanese style.  It wasn't nearly as cool as some of the other temples and government buildings that I have seen, but the view around it was quite nice.  From the peak where the central pagoda sits, you can look out over the river and into the city, and see the stadiums and skyline of Hiroshima.</p><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/train-station.jpg\"><img alt=\"train-station.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"90\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/train-station-thumb.jpg\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/outside-castle.jpg\"><img alt=\"outside-castle.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"120\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/outside-castle-thumb.jpg\" width=\"90\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/outside-castle-two.jpg\"><img alt=\"outside-castle-two.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"120\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/outside-castle-two-thumb.jpg\" width=\"90\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/far-from-pagoda.jpg\"><img alt=\"far-from-pagoda.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"90\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/far-from-pagoda-thumb.jpg\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/outside-pagoda.jpg\"><img alt=\"outside-pagoda.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"120\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/outside-pagoda-thumb.jpg\" width=\"90\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/hiroshima-stadiums.jpg\"><img alt=\"hiroshima-stadiums.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"120\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/hiroshima/hiroshima-stadiums-thumb.jpg\" width=\"90\"/></a>\n</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>Following our trip to the castle, we went to a really nice outdoor shopping center, and were able to see some fairly bizzare aspects of Japanese culture.
