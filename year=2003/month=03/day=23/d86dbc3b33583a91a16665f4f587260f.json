We left on Friday on the 11:30 <span class=\"caps\">AM </span>Shinsaken bullet train, and stopped in Kyoto for lunch.  When I stayed in Kyoto earlier in the trip, I never was able to make it to the top of the station to have a look at the tower, so we used our 1 hour layover to take a short trip to the top of the station.  The station has a series of many open-air escalators under a beautiful glass overhang.

Shibuya is a trendy spot to hang out for young people, and they were out in full force protesting the war in Iraq.
