We parked just next to a giant pineapple field, and there was a merchant on the side of the road selling fresh mangoes and lychees.  I had never had a lychee before, so I bought a few, and really liked them.  They are a small, red fruit with bumps all over them, and when peeled they reveal a tender, juicy, white flesh that tastes very similar to red grapes.</p><p>Following our short stop at the pineapple field, we reboarded the bus and headed back in the direction of the Australian Zoo, which I must say I found very disappointing.  I saw only a few animals that I had not already seen the previous day, and found the crocodile presentation to be a little slow and overrated.  Besides... Steve Irwin wasn't there, and that was kind of the point of the whole trip.
