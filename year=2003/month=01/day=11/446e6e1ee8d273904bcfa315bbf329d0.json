We started the day at 6:00 AM with a bus ride, and arrived in Moreton Bay around 7:30 AM.  We boarded a small racing sail-boat called <em>SOLO</em>, which has apparantly been around the world several times, and has won some fairly significant races.  The boat departed for our 3 hour sail over to the island.  We all enjoyed the boat ride out, which was smooth, sunny, and beautiful.</p><p>When we pulled into the island, we were allowed to jump off of the boat and take a swim over to the island.  Once on the island, we were treated to a variety of water sports, including tubing and snorkeling around sunken ships.  We were supposed to be allowed to sand board down 200 foot sand dunes, but the people running the trip claimed that the sand was too hot... but I don't buy it.  So, I went ahead and climbed the dunes on my own several times, and ran down them, jumped off them, and generally put myself into danger \u2014 lots of fun =)</p><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/brisbane/viewfromdune.jpg\"><img alt=\"viewfromdune.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"90\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/brisbane/viewfromdune-thumb.jpg\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/brisbane/meatopthedunes.jpg\"><img alt=\"meatopthedunes.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"90\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/brisbane/meatopthedunes-thumb.jpg\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>The island was stunningly beautiful, and had the bluest and clearest water that I have ever seen.
