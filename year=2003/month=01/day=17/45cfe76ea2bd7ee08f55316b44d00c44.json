The women in the show were each torn between a love for the oldest known living tradition in the world and a desire to better themselves and know themselves deeply.  I have a real and true appreciation for these people now, and I have already determined to pick up a book on the subject at my next location.

It seems that every major city in Australia has a botanical gardens, and I must say, they are the best part of every city I have been in thus far.  Certainly, Circular Quay and the Harbor are Sydney's most well known sites, and are breathtaking in the traditional sense, but for some reason these gardens fascinate me.  There is something very beautiful about a garden in the center of a large city.  The buildings soar overhead, while you look over long, beautiful fields spotted with exotic and beautiful foliage.  People are sprawled all about, eating, reading, typing away on their laptops, and enjoying the sun and natural surroundings on their collective lunch breaks.

The fact that you are there, and appreciating God's creation in the midst of man's skyscraping works is the whole point.
