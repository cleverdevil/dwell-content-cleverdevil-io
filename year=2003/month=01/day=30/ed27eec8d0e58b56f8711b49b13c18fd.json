A friend of mine from Wellington gave us some tips on where to go, and we headed out and met her at a little bar called <i>Zebo's</i>.  We stayed there for a little while, and then travelled to Wellington's most famous bar <i>The Fat Lady's Arms</i>, or as they lovingly call it <i>\"The Fats\"</i>.  The Fats is to bars what Waffle House is to restaurants.  As a result, The Fats has a sign inside proclaiming that it is \"the best bar in the world.\"  After my experience there, I don't doubt it.  We had a great time hanging out there, playing pool, and people-watching, and we eventually called it a night.</p><p>This morning, we went on a field trip with my Biology class to see Somes Island, which is a small island out in the center of Wellington's waterfront harbor.  The island used to be used as a quarantine for animal research, and has since been turned into a wildlife reserve.  We hopped on a ferry for a short 20 minute ride and arrived at the island around 11:00 AM.  We were free to walk on the island pretty much all day, and started by hiking around the island's perimeter.  While walking we encountered sheep, birds, and beautiful mountainous landscapes.  The view was also excellent, but we decided that walking around the island wasn't enough.</p><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/theferry.jpg\"><img alt=\"theferry.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"90\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/theferry-thumb.jpg\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/baseofisland.jpg\"><img alt=\"baseofisland.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"90\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/baseofisland-thumb.jpg\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/perimeterwalk.jpg\"><img alt=\"perimeterwalk.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"90\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/perimeterwalk-thumb.jpg\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><table align=\"center\" border=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/sheeponisland.jpg\"><img alt=\"sheeponisland.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"90\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/sheeponisland-thumb.jpg\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/meandscottinthetree.jpg\"><img alt=\"meandscottinthetree.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"120\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/meandscottinthetree-thumb.jpg\" width=\"90\"/></a>\n</td>\n<td>\n<a href=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/meontopofisland.jpg\"><img alt=\"meontopofisland.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"90\" src=\"http://www.skinnee.net/images/wellington/meontopofisland-thumb.jpg\" width=\"120\"/></a>\n</td>\n</tr></tbody></table><p>A few of us broke off from the rest of the group and left the path to find a way to climb to the island's peak.
