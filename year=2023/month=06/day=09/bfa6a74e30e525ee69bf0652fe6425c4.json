Unfortunately, in order to fit everything we had to skip on doing trivia in this episode, but don\u2019t worry! If wacky tech trivia is what you live for (like us), we did a trivia collab with the Vergecast where we went head-to-head so make sure to check that out! We also hopped on at the end of their emergency WWDC podcast for a fun lightning round at the end. There\u2019s a ton to get into with everything that Apple announced. This is a long one, but we hope you enjoy!
