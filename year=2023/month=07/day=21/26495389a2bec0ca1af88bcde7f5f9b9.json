Almost everything you've ever heard about this story has nothing to do with what's actually in the Bible, but what else is new? Around the 40-minute mark, we're joined by creator April Ajoy (of TikTok, Instagram, the Evangelicalish podcast, and more) to discuss the way this story constantly gets argued about by the internet's angry Christian men. Plus we talk Rapture trauma, childhood persecution fantasies, and other fun stuff!!! To be clear, this is the fun part of the episode. Let's also mostly wrap up the story of David, a boy who became a kingpin seemingly parodied by his own propaganda and just about the weirdest guy ever to pick as a supposed model for Jesus. His story's not quite done, but next time, we'll turn toward the original Finance Instagram bro: King Solomon. Intro song: k.d. lang's cover of \"Hallelujah\" Thank you for listening!
