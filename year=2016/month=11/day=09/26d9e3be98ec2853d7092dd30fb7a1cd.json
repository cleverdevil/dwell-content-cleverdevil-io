You are not alone.</p><p>To the Muslim community, and people of all faiths and creeds: your freedom to worship without fear of discrimination or persecution is so important to this country.

You are not alone.</p><p>Finally, to those of you who voted for our President-elect: I don't understand you, and I don't respect the man you voted for, but I will try to understand. I will try and hear you. I am guessing that you felt alone, and this is your response. Well, clearly you are not alone. Now, let's work together to listen to those who still feel alone: immigrants, victims of sexual assault, people of color, the LGBT community, muslims, the needy. Open your hearts to them and I will open mine to you. We won't agree on many things, but I ask you to listen, as I will listen to you. Who knows? Maybe we can actually continue the march of progress together.</p>",
