The answer is our new show: Dear Internet! On our new show, we delve deep into the dark corners of the internet, and find the people that need our help the most. There are some questions that you only dare ask the Internet. Hopefully the very real and serious advice we dole out will work to make the world a better place. This week we help a couple with their mushroom problem, we discuss whether or not you should pad out your resume with your World of Warcraft experience, and what to do when your new love interest only wants to go on dates that include hunting Big Foot. We are a new show, and would greatly appreciate if you could leave us a 5-star review on your podcast app of choice!
