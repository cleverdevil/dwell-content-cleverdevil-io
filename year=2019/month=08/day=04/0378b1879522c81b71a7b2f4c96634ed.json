Also does Known have a built-in editor for adding forms like newsletter subscriptions? OK one last question then I won't bother you anymore. Does it offer import from RSS feeds? I have blogs on write.as that I could potentially migrate to a Known instance, but that would probably require straight RSS import. Not only that, but I'd like to use it for a lifestream kind of thing, as in bring posts in from other feeds. Lol I'm scattered everywhere on the web. OK wow that was long, sorry!"
