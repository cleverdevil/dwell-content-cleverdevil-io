            "@cleverdevil I recently read Grant Morrison's run on DC's ANIMAL MAN (from 1988-1990, approximately). I'd only heard about the character and Morrison's take on it a few years back and realized this summer that most of it was available via the Comixology app.\nFrom Wikipedia: \"Morrison developed several long-running plots, introducing mysteries, some of which were not explained until a year or two later.... Morrison made the title character an everyman figure living in a universe populated by superheroes, aliens, and fantastic technology. Buddy's wife Ellen, his son Cliff (9 years old at the beginning of the series), and his daughter Maxine (5 years old) featured prominently in most storylines, and his relationship with them as husband and father was an ongoing theme.\nThe series championed vegetarianism and animal rights, causes Morrison himself supported. In one issue, Buddy helps a band of self-confessed eco-terrorists save a pod of dolphins. Enraged at a fisherman's brutality, Buddy drops him into the ocean, intending for him to drown. The man is saved by a dolphin.\nBuddy fought several menaces, such as an ancient, murderous spirit that was hunting him; brutal, murderous alien Thanagarian warriors; and even the easily defeated red robots of an elderly villain who was tired of life. The series made deep, sometimes esoteric, reference to the entire DC canon, including B'wana Beast, Mirror Master, and Arkham Asylum.\"\nAnyway, I can be fussy about superhero comics these days, but this was unfamiliar and entertainingly strange."
