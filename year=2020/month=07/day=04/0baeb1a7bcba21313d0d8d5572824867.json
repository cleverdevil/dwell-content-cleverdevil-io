On this weeks show, I mentioned a very good clip from impractical jokers. If you aren\u2019t familiar with the show, its kind of a reverse prank/public improv show that most people write off. In this clip, while doing their thing, a customer complains to the owner and they kind of run with it. Check it out below. Thank you for reading this, XOXO We are a new show, and would greatly appreciate if you could leave us a 5-star review on your podcast app of choice!
