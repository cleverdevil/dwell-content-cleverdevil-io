We thought it would be wrong to release this episode (which was recorded almost a month ago) without addressing the Black Live Matter protests currently taking place in our country. We hope you\u2019ll join us in donating to causes that are helping support the right to protest and to end oppression of our black and minority communities. On this weeks show we discuss kissing the homies goodnight, when horses are better than babies, and the ultimate sin, stealing and burying my good beans. Stay gold, XOXO We are a new show, and would greatly appreciate if you could leave us a 5-star review on your podcast app of choice! If you want more Dear Internet, please consider supporting us on patreon through Dear Internet. Sincerely, The coHosts- Nick Bristow, Jennifer Cheek, Michael DiMauro, and Tim Lanning!
