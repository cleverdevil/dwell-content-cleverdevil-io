I like the idea of hosted Known installations and would like seeing this roll out as a true hosted product you could sign up for. That still does not fix the issue of the, mostly required, plugins and connections unfortunately. A foundation could better manage things like that, draw in developers, and distribute development resources in a way that keeps community tools working well.\nI do definitely like what is happening with hosted micro.blog and would happily keep using it if I could introduce something like a cover page situation available with Known or WordPress. I\u2019m super interested in the idea of static page hosting, though... primarily due to its ease of portability. Jekyll excites me, and seems to be supported by GitHub, but lacks any kind of inherent connectivity or sharing capabilities.\nBasically, I\u2019d like to pay for what I\u2019ve got set up now, as a service, managed and run by a trusted company or organization!"
