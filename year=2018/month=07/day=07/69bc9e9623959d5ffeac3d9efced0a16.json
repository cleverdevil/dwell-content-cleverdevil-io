      "Thanks so much for writing this up, Daniel! Sadly, I think I contributed a lot to your frustration by having a conversation start, and then having to jump into other life things without having it finish. I certainly didn\u2019t intend to be dismissive in our conversation. I just had to run off to handle other life \u201cstuff.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I totally agree with the spirit of your post. After much more reading and research (thanks to you!), my personal plan is to stop registering new .io domains.\n\nFor my existing .io domains, I\u2019ll be setting up an annual contribution to support the Chagossian people in larger amounts to help transform them into positive impact.\n\nAs the original author of the comment about depression and anxiety, I want you to know I stand behind that comment. I got myself into deep trouble by going down rabbit holes where every action I\u2019ve taken (products I\u2019ve purchased, movies I\u2019ve watched, music I have listened to, every little thing in the world) ends up connected to something harmful. It\u2019s a complicated, and yes, political world. I strongly believe in being thoughtful and cautious with my actions, but I won\u2019t do the world any good if I descend into depression and become paralyzed to act. I have to choose my battles.\n\nThanks again for writing this up, Daniel, and know that your personal advocacy was helpful to me in understanding how I can fit into the larger context of making a positive impact on the world!"
