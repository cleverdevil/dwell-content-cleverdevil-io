      "Ben, thanks for having the courage to write this post! For those of us who struggle with anxiety and depression, the current state of affairs in the world is staggeringly difficult to navigate. In my experience, one of the most helpful things is shared experiences with others who are also struggling. I'm with you, right there, struggling along side. Every day brings a new challenge. Its good to know that there are others struggling along with me.\n\nWhat I've been grappling with the most is wanting to tune out what's going on with our government because its harmful to my mental health, but then realizing that my exercising my privilege as a wealthy white man in that way does a disservice to those who are being hurt, disenfranchised, and discriminated against. I can't just tune it out, I have to fight! But, where can I find the energy? How can I balance my mental health with the tragedy that is going on in the world?\n\nAgain, thank you for sharing. You're not alone. <3"
