These custom intents are designed to be created for very specific use cases and then exposed as shortcuts so that you can access them quickly from your lock screen, add them to a workflow, or activate them with a custom voice command that the user creates.

I am very much looking forward to the significant Siri improvements that\u00a0<em>are</em> present in iOS, but more importantly, its clear that Apple has laid the groundwork in a very novel way for a fully programmable Siri.</p>",
