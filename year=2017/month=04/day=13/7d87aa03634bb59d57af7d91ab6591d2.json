In fact, other than some cut and paste work and changing the microformats, it should be a simple thing. I'd almost feel guilty for \"stealing\" it. \nI've started hacking away at a Read plugin similar to the bookmark or like functionalities that simply bookmarks articles which I've read online, but it's got some quirky upstream issues that need to be solved before I can finish it. Ultimately it's really for online content more so than books (or even magazines) though.
