Early indications\u00a0had me optimistic that between a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HQ4BRIG/\">solid indoor antenna</a>, an\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.silicondust.com/product/hdhomerun-connect/\">HDHomeRun Connect</a>\u00a0tuner, and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.plex.tv/features/live-tv-dvr/\">Live TV and DVR functionality</a>\u00a0from\u00a0<a href=\"http://plex.tv/\">Plex</a>, I'd at least have my problems solved when it comes to the major networks. Sadly, that's turned out not to be true.</p><h3>Plex + HDHomeRun: Not Ready for Prime Time</h3><p>As I mentioned before, the HDHomeRun is great, and the antenna does pull in many\u00a0channels, but its not nearly as reliable as I had hoped, with my local NBC and CBS affiliates being far too spotty. In addition, Plex's DVR and Live TV functionality is extremely unreliable, with recordings going hours over time, hanging completely, or causing my Plex Media Server to crash. I could certainly continue down the rabbit hole by investing in a more powerful\u00a0outdoor antenna, but they're costly, and there's\u00a0still the matter of Plex's buggy support for DVR and Live TV. At this point, I don't recommend this path for most people.</p><h3>Evaluating Streaming Services</h3><p>With OTA off the table, it was time to start investigating streaming services that offer live TV functionality and cloud DVR. My priorities were:</p><ol><li>Local affiliates for\u00a0the major networks: NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox.</li>\n<li>Full access to ESPN and its associated networks, including access\u00a0to WatchESPN.</li>\n<li>Access to Disney networks for the kids.</li>\n<li>More cost effective than DirecTV, my current service provider.</li>\n</ol><p>First, I took a look at\u00a0<a href=\"http://sling.com\">Sling TV</a>, which provides a highly-recommended a-la-carte service that meets many of my criteria.

However, my free trial of the service was a total disaster. It took\u00a0<em>days</em> for my account to activate, and my attempts to contact support resulted in announced hold times measured in\u00a0<em>hours</em>. When I finally was able to get things working, the quality was pretty low, and the app experience left a lot to be desired.
