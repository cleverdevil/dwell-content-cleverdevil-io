      "I know it sounds crazy, but yeah, 195 degrees was the target temperature of the meat, with the smoker starting out at 225, and then ramping up to 275 by the end, to help the pork shoulder through the &quot;stall,&quot; where it can stay for hours at the same temperature due to &quot;evaporative cooling.&quot;\n\nYou can find out a bit more about smoking pork shoulders, and &quot;the stall,&quot; here: http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/the_stall.html\n\nPretty much every recipe out there for pulled pork calls for a target meat temperature of 190-205.\n\nThe meat turned out tender, juicy, and delicious as always! I enjoyed some leftovers today for lunch. Tasty!"
