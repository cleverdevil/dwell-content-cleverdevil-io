She even canceled her one meeting with a man, an appearance on Snoop Dogg\u2019s podcast, so she could have an entirely penis-free day. And she\u2019s planning on ending the day by going with her girlfriends to a 90-minute seminar on fertility and reproductive rights.</p></blockquote><p>I love her honesty and willingness to be candid about every personal struggle. Notably, I laughed out loud when I read about her evolving decision-making process around selecting projects, in light of her fresly\u00a0nutured\u00a0feminism:</p><blockquote><p>And now that she\u2019s got a financial cushion from Zootopia and Secret Life of Pets, she can act on what she\u2019s learned and say \u201cno\u201d more often. Specifically, she\u2019s drawing the line at any movie that, she says, \u201cmakes it okay to laugh about things like women\u2019s bodies after birth, like when women who\u2019ve just had babies are referring to their vaginas as all ruined. I think it\u2019s really rude for someone to disparage a vagina in the female body after it\u2019s just fucking created and exploded a baby into our world. It makes me furious and I will not change my opinion on that.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Love, love, love Jenny Slate. Worth a read!</p>",
