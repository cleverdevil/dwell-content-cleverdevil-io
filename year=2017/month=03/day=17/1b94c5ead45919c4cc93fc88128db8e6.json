And I thought, Hell, where do you get shoelaces? And my friend said, there\u2019s a place over off I-84, it\u2019s the Designer Shoe Warehouse. So I go over there, and it\u2019s a building the size of the Pentagon. It\u2019s enormous. If you took somebody from \u2014 I don\u2019t know, pick a country where they don\u2019t have Designer Shoe Warehouses \u2014 blindfolded them and turned them loose in this place, they would just think, <em>You people are insane</em>.
