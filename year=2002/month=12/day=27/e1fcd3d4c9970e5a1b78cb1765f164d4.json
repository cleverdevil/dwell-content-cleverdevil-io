I wish that Atlanta had a nice rail system that I could utilize, it sure beats traffic.  But I digress....</p><p>We started out the day by hitting the B&amp;H Camera Shop, where I was able to pick up a new battery for my digital camera, and a nice leather case.  Then we walked over to Grand Central Station to eat at the Oyster Bar, which is an excellent little restraunt with wonderful soup and seafood.  Grand Central is such a beautiful public space of the kind that I don't expect to see again in this country.
